Bluetooth 24Hour Blood Pressure Monitor

This project comprises of work completed for my final year digital systems project of a Bluetooth 24 Hour Blood Pressure Monitor.
The android application has been tested on a Cubot X18 and X19S.
The device project can be open and build with STM32CubeIDE Version: 1.4.2.
The microcontroller currently used and tested with is an ST Nucleo F446RE with components: 

Pressure sensor: NXP MP3V5050GP.

Motor/Pump: KPM27C-6B1 micro air pump, 6V.

Solenoid Valve: JQF1 – 3V.

Bluetooth Module (UART): HC – 08 BLE Serial Bluetooth Module.

6V Power Supply by 4 AA Batteries, with a PN2222A transistor used as a switch to switch motor/pump.

There is a small exhaust port in the tubing to allow pressure to release as the cuff decays, unfortunately this is of unknown brand but releases approx 1-3mmhg of pressure per second.

Please read the digital systems write up for more information.
